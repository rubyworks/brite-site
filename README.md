# Brite Site

This repository provides a good starting point for creating website with blog
with [Brite](http://rubyworks.github.com/brite), the static website generator.

The site files are organized neatly with all site assets in an `assets` 
directory.

Layouts are in `assets/layouts`. You will surely want to edit those files
first thing.

An atom feed template is provided, though it probably needs a little fine tuning
yet.

The `tags.page` provides a page of links to the rest of you site, divided into
tag categories.

While the site as given is nice and neat, Brite is flexible, so you can 
reorganize the site to your hearts content.

To learn more, head over to the main [Brite](http://rubyworks.github.com/brite)
website.
